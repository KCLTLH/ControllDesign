### <center> In this practice we will compare Analog speed control to a Digital speed control system with operation velocity V<sub>0</sub> = 25 m/s and T<sub>sampling</sub> = 0.5 sec. Also, practice using Simulink in this problem set. </center>

### As the plot shown above, "Digital" seems to fit "Analog" pretty well, how there is still little difference between.

## How can we solve it? ðŸ’¬
### Shrink the sampling time. (e.g T<sub>sampling</sub> from 0.5 sec to 0.01 sec)

## How can we solve it? ðŸ’­
### Re-design the PID controller. (We will talk about it in further homework.)
